The lighting is warm and golden, evoking a nostalgic and magical atmosphere. The characters have expressive, youthful faces with large, soulful eyes and simple, clean features. They wear whimsical, slightly old-fashioned clothing with earthy or pastel tones, moving through a serene, slightly fantastical countryside village. Small, imaginative details abound â€” soot sprites hiding in corners, oversized plants, rustic cottages with moss-covered roofs, mysterious spirits lurking in the shadows, and gentle wind rustling through tall grass. The environment feels alive and gently surreal, blending elements of everyday life with quiet magic. The entire composition has a painterly, storybook quality, with a focus on emotion, nature, and wonder â€” reminiscent of My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle. Soft shadows, gentle color palettes, and a touch of whimsy complete the scene.",
